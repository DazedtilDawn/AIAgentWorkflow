# Multi-Role Pipeline Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow implements an optimized CI/CD pipeline for the AI Agent Workflow system. The pipeline is designed for maximum efficiency and parallel execution where possible, while maintaining proper job dependencies and security.

## Workflow Structure

The pipeline is organized into distinct phases:

### 1. Initial Analysis (Parallel)
- Product Manager
- Brainstorm Facilitator
- Architect

### 2. Planning and Implementation (Parallel)
- Planner
- Engineer

### 3. Quality Assurance (Parallel)
- Reviewer
- QA Engineer

### 4. Deployment Pipeline (Sequential)
- Deploy to Staging (dev environment)
- Deploy to Production (prod environment)
- Production Monitoring

## Optimizations

### Composite Actions
- Reusable Python setup action in `.github/actions/setup-python`
- Standardized dependency installation and caching

### Artifact Management
- Retention policies (5 days)
- Targeted artifact paths
- Matrix-based artifact naming

### Security Enhancements
- OIDC authentication for AWS
- Role-based access
- Enhanced permissions scope

### Resource Optimization
- Parallel execution using matrix strategy
- Dependency caching
- Minimal artifact storage

## Environment Configuration

### Development (Staging)
- Environment: `dev`
- URL: https://dev.example.com
- Concurrency: staging_environment

### Production
- Environment: `prod`
- URL: https://prod.example.com
- Concurrency: production_environment

## Required Secrets

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: API key for Gemini AI model access
- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: ARN for AWS IAM role with deployment permissions

## Workflow Triggers

- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main branch
- Manual workflow dispatch
- Daily schedule (midnight UTC)

## Artifacts

Each job produces artifacts that are stored for 5 days:
- Product specifications
- Brainstorm outcomes
- System architecture
- Development plans
- Implementation code
- Review reports
- Test results
- Deployment logs
- Monitoring reports
