# AI-Driven Development Framework

A comprehensive, advanced AI-driven software development framework that automates the entire development process using multiple specialized AI agents.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized AI agents for different roles in the development lifecycle
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated CI/CD pipeline with role-based stages
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Integration**: High-performance AI completions for each agent
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated testing with UI/API validation
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS deployment and monitoring capabilities

## Agents

1. **Product Manager**: Generates product specifications from requirements
2. **Brainstorm Facilitator**: Manages ideation and solution evaluation
3. **Architect**: Creates system architecture and technical specifications
4. **Planner**: Generates detailed development plans
5. **Engineer**: Implements code and generates tests
6. **Reviewer**: Reviews code quality and test coverage
7. **QA Engineer**: Designs and runs comprehensive tests
8. **Monitoring Analyst**: Analyzes system metrics and user behavior
9. **Refactor Analyst**: Identifies code improvements and maintains quality

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
   - Required AWS credentials for deployment

## Usage

The framework can be run either through GitHub Actions or locally:

### GitHub Actions
Push to the main branch or create a pull request to trigger the pipeline.

### Local Development
Run individual agents:
```bash
python ai_agents/product_manager.py --output docs/PRODUCT_SPECS.md
python ai_agents/architect.py --input docs/PRODUCT_SPECS.md --output docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
# ... and so on for other agents
```
