# Development Plan

## Task Breakdown

## File Structure

### Directories

### Files

## Implementation Order

### Critical Path

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Frontend (Mobile and Web) development can proceed in parallel with backend development once the initial API contracts are defined.  Use mock data initially.
- Different features within the mobile app can be developed concurrently (e.g., Market Listing and Vendor Profile).
- Testing can be integrated throughout the development lifecycle.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Backend: Test individual functions and classes in the services and controllers.  Focus on validating business logic and data transformations. Aim for high code coverage (80%+).
- Frontend: Test individual components in isolation. Verify that they render correctly and handle user interactions as expected. Use mocking for API calls.

### Integration Tests
- Backend: Test interactions between different services and components. Verify that data flows correctly and that APIs work as expected.
- Example: Test the Market Search API by verifying that it returns the correct markets based on geolocation.
- Frontend: Test interactions between different components and the backend APIs.
- Example: Test the Market Listing screen by verifying that it displays the correct data from the Market Service.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
- Test the entire application flow from the user interface to the database.  Automate key user scenarios.
- Example:  A user registers, logs in, searches for a market, views the market details, and browses the vendor profiles.
- Tools: Cypress, Jest, Selenium, or Detox
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
- Involve target users in testing the application to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations.
- **Security Testing:**  Perform penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).  Test authentication and authorization mechanisms thoroughly.
- **Performance Testing:**  Load test the backend APIs to ensure that they can handle a large number of requests.  Monitor response times and identify performance bottlenecks.  Test the mobile app on different devices and network conditions to ensure that it loads quickly and performs smoothly.
- **Geolocation Accuracy:**  Verify that the geolocation-based search is accurate and reliable.
- **Push Notification Delivery:**  Test that push notifications are delivered reliably and on time.

### End-to-End Tests

## Documentation Requirements

### API Documentation
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request parameters
- Response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes
- Provide rollback procedures in case of deployment failures.
- **User Documentation:**
- Create user guides and FAQs for the mobile app and the Market Organizer Portal.
- Consider creating video tutorials to demonstrate key features.
- **Code Comments:**
- Write clear and concise comments in the code to explain the purpose of functions, classes, and other code elements.

### Development Guides
- Provide guides for setting up the development environment, building the application, running tests, and contributing code.
- Include code style guidelines and best practices.

### Deployment Instructions
- Document the steps for deploying the backend and frontend to the target environments (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform).
- **Monitoring and Logging:**  Set up monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of the application.  Use a centralized logging system to collect logs from all components.
- **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that the mobile app is accessible to users with disabilities (WCAG compliance).
- **Internationalization (i18n):**  Plan for future internationalization by using i18n libraries and storing text in resource files.

## Component Details

## External Integrations

### Okay, based on the provided development plan, here's a breakdown of the external integrations that will likely be required, along with their specifications

**Purpose:**
Provide geolocation data (latitude and longitude) based on user input (address, zip code).
Enable proximity-based search for markets (find markets near a user's location).
Calculate distances between the user and markets.
Potentially provide reverse geocoding (convert coordinates to address).
**Examples:** Google Maps API, Mapbox API, HERE Technologies
Send push notifications to users' mobile devices for various events (e.g., new market announcements, vendor promotions, order updates).
**Examples:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Apple Push Notification Service (APNs), OneSignal
Process payments for transactions between vendors and customers (if the platform facilitates direct sales).
Securely handle credit card and other payment information.
**Examples:** Stripe, PayPal, Braintree
User registration and login.
Password management (reset, recovery).
Social login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Role-based access control (RBAC).
**Examples:** Leaflet, React Leaflet, Google Maps SDK for Android/iOS, Mapbox GL JS/Native
Track user behavior within the application.
Gather data for analytics dashboards and reports.
Monitor application performance.
**Examples:** Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Firebase Analytics
**Examples:** AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Logging, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk
**Examples:** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage
**Examples:** AWS RDS (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Google Cloud SQL, MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL or MySQL on a VM


**Authentication:**


**Rate Limits & Quotas:**


**Cost Implications:**


**Implementation Notes:**
Choose a service with good accuracy and coverage in the target geographic areas.
Implement error handling for API failures.
Consider using a library or SDK to simplify API integration.
Handle user privacy concerns related to location data.
Handle device token registration and management.
Implement notification queuing and retry mechanisms.
Segment users for targeted notifications.
Provide users with control over notification preferences.
Consider the platform-specific differences in notification handling (Android vs. iOS).
Compliance with PCI DSS standards for handling payment data.
Securely store and manage payment credentials.
Implement fraud detection and prevention measures.
Handle payment errors and refunds gracefully.
Consider supporting multiple payment methods.
Securely store user credentials.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Handle account recovery securely.
Integrate with authorization mechanisms to control access to resources.
Choose a library that is compatible with the frontend framework being used (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).
Optimize map rendering performance.
Handle map loading errors.
Consider accessibility for users with disabilities.
Implement proper data privacy and security measures.
Be transparent with users about data collection practices.
Use analytics data to improve the user experience.
Choose a logging service that integrates well with your infrastructure.
Implement structured logging for easier querying and analysis.
Implement alerting for critical events.
Securely store and manage log data.
Implement proper security measures to protect user data.
Optimize image sizes and formats for efficient storage and delivery.
Consider using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for faster image delivery.
**Prioritization:**  Prioritize these integrations based on the critical path and business needs.  For example, authentication and geolocation are likely critical for initial functionality.
**API Contracts:** The "initial API contracts" mentioned in the development plan are essential.  These contracts should clearly define the request and response formats for each API endpoint. This allows frontend and backend development to proceed in parallel using mock data initially.
**Testing:** Thorough testing of all integrations is crucial.  Integration tests and end-to-end tests should cover all key user scenarios and data flows.
**Security:** Security should be a top priority.  Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, protect sensitive data, and conduct regular security audits.
**Monitoring:** Monitor the performance and health of all integrations.  Set up alerts for errors and performance bottlenecks.
**Scalability:** Design the integrations to be scalable to handle future growth.
**Documentation:**  Document all integrations thoroughly, including API keys, endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling.
