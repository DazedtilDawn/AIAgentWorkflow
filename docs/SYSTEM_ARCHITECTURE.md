# System Architecture

## Overview

The system architecture for the personal finance application is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable. It adopts a microservices architecture for the backend, enabling independent deployment and scaling of individual services. The frontend will be a cross-platform mobile application, and the system will leverage cloud-native technologies for infrastructure and deployment.
